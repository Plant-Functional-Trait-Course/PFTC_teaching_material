# The trait wheel

This protocol shows how to collect, measure, check and document leaf functional traits for vascular plants using the trait wheel^TW^ (@fig-trait-wheel).
The protocol is based on the trait handbook from Perez-Harguindeguy et al. [-@Perez-Harguindeguy2013-nv].

## Collecting leaves in the field

Be careful at all time when working in the experiment and avoid stepping on the experimental plots.
Make yourself familiar with the experimental design (check the site maps), and how plot, blocks and sites are marked.

To collect plants, go to your plot and use a sitting mat to sit next to the plot.
Collect the leaves and minimize disturbing the surroundings as much as possible.

We will collect traits in three different locations/experiments:

- At four sites along an elevational gradient (500 - 1300 m a.s.l.), with and without grazing
- Incline project: four sites with ambient and warming using OTCs
- ThreeD project: two sites with different global change treatments including ambient/warming using transplants, nitrogen addition and grazing

The specific sampling and number of species will vary between the different projects, but we will focus on the following alpine and general species:

```{r}
#| label: sp-list
#| echo: false
tibble(Taxon = c(# Incline wishlist (alpine)
                        "Sibbaldia procumbens",

                        ),
       Type = c(rep("alpine", 12),
                rep("general", 5))) |> kbl()
```


**Intraspecific group**

We will work within the **INCLINE project plots** (see @fig-exp-designIncline) focusing on:
- 4 sites along a precipitation gradient
- a warming treatment (OTC vs Ambient)
- 16 grassland species

Follow the species list for our group (see @label-sp-list) and work within the OTC and control plots. DO NOT collect plants from within the marked rectangular INCLINE plots or if there is a trampled zone around the plots. We will collect a maximum of 10 individuals per species, per treatment, per site. Ideally, we will find 2 individuals/per species for each treatment and from 5 of the 7 blocks (a pair of OTCs and control plots). Our minimum is 5 individuals per species/treatment/site.  

Choose reproductively mature adults with fully expanded leaves (i.e. not seedlings), and individuals with healthy-looking leaves (i.e. not grazed, no signs of pathogen or herbivore attack, no discoloration). Each individual should be at least one to two meters away from each other, to avoid sampling individuals from the same genetic individual.  

Before collecting the individual, measure its height (see below). For very large individuals that we won't collect the whole plant, i.e. shrubs, large forbs, we will collect 3-5 leaves from the individual, making sure to include the petiole. If you are uncertain whether something is a leaf vs. leaflet, ask your group leader.  

If you cannot find 5 individuals of each species, that is ok. After a reasonable search, we'll move on.

#| fig-alt: "A conceptual figure showing the experimental design and plot set up."

knitr::include_graphics('images/sites/PFTC6 INCLINE Sampling Regime Overview Short.jpg')
```

**Global change group and elevational gradient**

For the **ThreeD project** we will collect the following treatments:
- 3 ambient controls
- 3 warm controls
- ambient natural grazing
- ambient and warm N levels: 5, 10, 50 and 150

Each plot is 50 x 50 cm large and has an inner and outer part (see @fig-exp-design2).
The plots are marked with metal tubes in each corner and a label on the top.
The leaves should be collected from the outer part (destructive part) and if possible the inner part should stay untouched.

For the **elevational gradient**, we will in addition collect leaves at HÃ¸gsete and Vikelsand inside and outside the fence.
For this, we will collect species according to the seedclim controls.
The plants will not be collected from the plots, but from within the blocks, and from outside the fence.


```{r}
#| label: fig-exp-design2
#| fig-cap: "A) The experiment are set up along an elevational gradient that represents a productivity gradient. The experimental treatments are warming (brown), a grdient of nitrogen addition (grey to green) and their combination. These treatments are crossed with four grazing treatment: control (no clipping), intermediate and intensive clipping, and natural grazing outside the grazing exclosure. B) Example of a plot divided into non destructive (inner square) and and destructive sampling area (outer square)."
#| fig-alt: "A conceptual figure showing the experimental design and plot set up."

knitr::include_graphics('images/sites/ExperimentalDesign.jpg')
```

We aim to collect leaves from the species that make up 80% of the cover in each plot.
For each plot we will generate a species list.
Below is an example code to generate such a species list:

```{r cumsum, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

threshold <-  80

cover |> 
  select(turfID, species, cover) |> 
  group_by(turfID) |> 
  arrange(turfID, -cover) |> 
  mutate(cumsum = cumsum(cover)) |> 
  filter(cumsum <= threshold)

```

For each plot and species find 5 individuals that are spread across the plot to avoid sampling clones.
Choose reproductively mature adults with fully expanded leaves (i.e. not seedlings) and healthy-looking leaves (i.e. not grazed, no signs of pathogen or herbivore attack, no discoloration).

For the grazing treatments, try to find mature and fully grown leaves if possible.

Measure the height of each individual plant and note down the height on the zip-loc bag (see below).

Collect 1 leaf from the individual, making sure to include the petiole (@fig-leaf-anatomy).
If you are uncertain whether something is a leaf vs. leaflet (@fig-leaflets), ask your group leader.

If you cannot find 5 individuals of each species, that is ok.
After a reasonable search, move on to the next species or plot.

**Measuring vegetative height of individual plants in the field**

Measure the vegetative height of the individual plant in the field (@fig-height).
Vegetative height is the shortest distance between the main photosynthetic tissue on the plant and the ground, excluding any reproductive structure (e.g. buds, flowers or fruits).
Leave the plant in it's natural form and do not stretch the plant if it bends.

Different plants will require different measures of height.
@fig-height shows a couple of typical examples.
For cushion plants (A), stick a the ruler into the cusion all the way to the ground.
For forbs and graminoids (B, D, E) measure the main stem leaves, and do not stretch the leaves (D, F, G ).

#| fig-cap: "Different plant types and how to measure height."
#| fig-alt: "Different plant types and how to measure height."

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/height.png")

```


Record this measurement using legibly numbers (@fig-numbers) on the zip-loc bag.
Place the leaf/leaves for each individual in a bag with wet paper towels for transfer to lab.

## Preparing leaves for measuring traits in lab

Select one (for the global change group) or five (for the intraspecific group) leaf/leaves per individual.
For analysing chemical traits such as percent P, C, N and isotopes, a certain amount of dry biomass is needed.
Make sure that we are collecting 0.03 g (30 mg) dried leaf material.
Otherwise select several leaves until there is enough dry weight.
This is called a bulk sample and should be indicated on the envelope (e.g. count the nr of leaves).

When collecting the leaf, include petiole and rachis (@fig-leaflets).
Pat the leaf dry with a tissue if there is visible water on the surface.
Add a sticker to enter the information and a barcode sticker to the envelope (@fig-label and @fig-barcode).
Attach the sticker with a stapler.

## Warning for special cases.

Carefully check the rules for how to measure special plant species plants.

- *Festuca sp* have tightly rolled leaves and they should not be unfolded for the scanning.
- *Hyperzia sp* and *Lycopodium sp* have tiny leaves. Choose a 10cm piece of stem and scrape of all the leaves from this part for scanning. Make sure the leaves do not overlap
:::

## Wet mass

Make sure the envelopes are still kept wet.
Weigh each leaf and write the weight on the envelope, including all digits.

## Measure leaf area using a scanner

For scanning the leaves we are using a Rasperry Pi setup.
The Pis control the scanners, ensuring consistency, and validate file names. 

::: callout-note
## Raspberry Pi setup

For more information on the Raspberry Pi setup, see the readme file in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Plant-Functional-Trait-Course/pi_setup).
:::

*Start setup*

Connect your Laptop to the Raspberry PI. Connect the PI with an ethernet cable to your laptop.
Connect the scanner to the PI.
Connect the barcode scanner to the PI.
Connect the power cable to the PI.

Wait for one minute.

Open VNC Viewer and type in the IP address corresponding to your PI (@tbl-pi-ip).

Resize the screen for convenience.

*Scan leaves*

Make sure the envelopes are still kept wet.
Check that the scanner is clean and free of debris.
Clean if needed.
Place wet leaf face-down on the scanner.
Make sure the leaf is not folded and that leaflets do not overlap.
The leaf should not go all the way to the edge of the scanner, because each picture will be cropped.
You can cut the leaf into several pieces if needed, but please make a remark if you do so (e.g. cut 3).
You can tape the leaf to the scanner using transparent tape if it folds (e.g. grasses).

For **graminoids** (grasses, sedges, rushes): Spread graminoid blades flat and tape to scanner if necessary to hold them in place.
Exclude the leaf sheath (@fig-leaf).

```{r}

::: callout-warning
## Special cases for scanning

Carefully check the rules for how to scan special plant species plants.

-   *Festuca sp* have tightly rolled leaves and they should not be unfolded for the scanning.
:::




*Scan, save and check the leaf*

Click on the leaf icon (only needs to be done the first time).
This will start the scanning program.
If the scanner cannot be found, wait for a bit and try again.
Check the settings of the scanner.
These should be set as standard, so please do not touch them if not needed.

The scanner settings should be:

-   saved in Desktop/leaf_scans/
-   Type: JPEG
-   Colour
-   Full colour range
-   300dpi

From here, do this for each leaf:

Press scan (at the bottom of the window) and wait a couple of seconds until the scanning process is done.
A new window will pop up.
Adjust the zoom to see the full picture (about 25%).
Check the quality of the scan (has the whole leaf been scanned, is the leaf not upside down, dirt on the scan, etc.).
If the scan is not ok, adjust the leaf and repeat the scan.

When the scan is ok, click on the green save button to save the scan.
Make sure the cursor marks the filename (should be default).
Scan the barcode on the envelope of the leaf that has been scanned with the barcode reader.
The filename should be something like: AAA4667 (3 letters and 4 digits).
When the scan is saved, the PI will check that the LeafID and that the scanning settings (dpi, etc.) are correct.
If anything is wrong, it will open a window with an error message (@fig-error).
Please read it!

```{r}
#| label: fig-error
#| fig-cap: "Error message on the PI."
#| fig-alt: "Screenshot of an error message on the PI."

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/error.png")

```

Click anywhere in the window and it will disappear.
Save the scan with the correct name or scan the leaf again if the settings are wrong.
MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE SCAN WITH THE WRONG NAME OR SETTING. Tick the box on the envelope that the leaf has been scanned.
Make sure the scanned leaves are kept wet and move them to the next station.

From time to time:

When you are finished with scanning click on the yoda icon.
This will check the leafIDs.
If anything is wrong it will open a window and indicate which scans are wrong.
Make sure to fix all the wrong leafIDs and not to have duplicate scans before leaving the station.

Before leaving the station:

Copy all the scans onto a stick and deposit them on the PFTC6 hard drive.
Shut down the pi.
Wait 1 min to disconnect it from the power.

```{r thick, out.width='18%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/Thickness.png")

```

## Leaf thickness

Make sure the envelopes are still kept wet.
Thickness varies over the surface of the leaf; generally, the leaf is thickest at the midrib, primary veins, margins, and leaf base.
Avoid the midrib when measuring leaf thickness, unless the leaf is too small (@fig-vein).
Take three thickness measurements at several points on the lamina and note them on the envelope.
From this, we will later calculate the average thickness.
If the leaf is small, it may not be possible to take three unique measurements.

```{r}
#| label: fig-vein
#| fig-cap: "Showing where leaf thickness can be measured and where not, e.g. the midrib."
#| fig-alt: "A photo of a leaf showing valind an not valid points such as the midrib to measure leaf thickness."
#| #| out-width: 70%

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/veins.jpg")

```

**Ferns** Make sure you do not measure thickness on the spore-producing sori on the backside of ferns.

```{r entry, out.width='15%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/Data.png")

```

## Data entry

Ideally the envelope should still be kept wet until this point in case any information is missing.
Go to this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncqbniu0NUzCfcNe2fOl6M2Yj-BeOEXcYlPZHwNiIbk/edit?usp=sharing).
Connect a barcode scanner to your computer.
Scan the barcode of an envelope.
Make sure that your cursor is in the right cell (ID).
Enter all the data that is on the envelope (for details see @tbl-info).
If any of the information is missing, check if it has been forgotten.
Has the leaf been scanned, one thickness measurement is missing, etc.
If anything is missing bring the leaf back to the according station in the trait wheel.
When finished, check the box on the envelope that the data has been entered.
Take a picture of the envelope.
Bring the envelop to the drying station.


```{r dry, out.width='10%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/Dry.png")

```

## Dry mass

The leaves will be dried in the oven for 72 hours at 65Â°C.

```{r check, out.width='15%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/Check.png")

```

## Data checking

*Check scans* Find the folder with the leave scans on google drive: link Open each scan and check the follwing criterias:

-   Is the whole leaf on the scan?
-   Has nothing else been scanned (cable, paper,...)?
-   Is there dirty the scan?
-   Has the leaf been cut? If yes, is it indicated on the envelope?
-   How many leaves are on the scan? If \> 1 is there a remark on the envelope?

*Check data* Open RStudio project and the R script (...).
Download the trait data from google sheet.
Check if the leafID is valid.
Check if the variables have valid entries.
E.g. correct day, site name, elevations, etc.
Check if missing values can be found on the envelope or retrieved from the data.
Plot the data to check if traits have unrealistic values.
For more details see section data curation.

# PFTC 6 Course information

## Logistics

The PFTC6 course will run from *23. July - 5. August 2022* and will be held in *Aurland*, western Norway. 
The location is near Bergen where the course team will be assembling before traveling to Aurland. 
Transport from Bergen to Aurland (by bus or car) can be organized by the course leaders.
If you arrive via Oslo or elsewhere, transport to Aurland (by train or bus) needs to be organized by yourself. 
All flights to Bergen should be scheduled to arrive at the latest on 22nd of July and depart at the earliest on 6th of August from Bergen (other travel needs to arrive in Aurland on the 23rd at the latest, and depart on the 5th at the latest).


<!-- ## Course details -->

<!-- The participants will be divided into 6 groups, as described in the advertisement. For group assignments, see the end of this email. -->

<!-- The course has several components: -->

<!-- - Literature review and discussions within groups (pre-course) -->
<!-- - Online lectures and discussions (pre-course) -->
<!-- - Lectures and discussions about various aspects of trait-based ecology, natural history of Norway, climate change ecology, and ecological data collection, management, analyses and inference (during the course). -->
<!-- - Project field and lab work. Each group will have the responsibility for planning and conducting the field and lab work to collect the data for their research project. This will be the largest part of the course, because we aim to collect “real” and publishable data sets.  -->
<!-- - To facilitate broader hands-on experience, students will also get the opportunity to switch groups for a shorter period, and they will get the opportunity to join the ‘other traits day’ to learn about an aspect of trait-based ecology not covered in this course. -->
<!-- - Data curation, documentation and analysis of the group project data (during the course). We consider these critically important skills for reproducible research, and give them high priority. The datasets collected will be published as a student co-authored data paper. -->
<!-- - Science communications module (group 6). While group six is responsible for this survey, all students will take part in this project and interview local people about their opinions on climate change (during course) -->
<!-- - (optional) - Participate in writing up the project data for a scientific publication (after the course) -->


<!-- ## Course Credit Options -->

<!-- There are two options for course credit. -->

<!-- - 5 ECTS for attending (reading papers, preparation of the group work with group leader, participating actively in the course, presenting the results at the end of the course and writing a short data documentation report); THIS IS COMPULSORY IF YOU ATTEND THE COURSE -->

<!-- - 10 ECTS is possible if you contribute an additional 150 h after the course to collaboratively with other course participants write a more comprehensive scientific paper for submission to a relevant scientific journal. For these credits to be awarded, documentation of the the additional hours and tasks performed have to be submitted to the course leaders; OPTIONAL -->

<!-- ## Group projects -->

<!-- ### Plastic trait responses to climate change.  -->

<!-- This group will harness existing climate change experiments (Open Top Chambers) to assess plastic trait responses to experimental warming and biotic interactions in plants from alpine vs. warmer-climate origins. This group will collaborate with group 3 to understand how this variability impacts leaf ecophysiology. Group leader: Sonya Geange -->


<!-- ### Plant trait responses to global change.  -->

<!-- This group will assess community trait distribution responses to the interactive effects of warmer climate, nitrogen deposition, and grazing along an elevational gradient, and explore consequences for plant community assembly and ecosystem functioning. This group will collaborate with groups 3 and 4 to understand plant and ecosystem functional consequences of these community shifts. Group leaders: Julia Chacon & Aud Halbritter -->


<!-- ### Leaf traits as a tool to understand climate impacts on photosynthesis and respiration.  -->

<!-- This group will study how plant temperatures and photosynthetic rates vary between plants with alpine or warmer-climate origin, along elevational gradients, and in response to global change drivers. Group 3 will collaborate with groups 1 and 2 to put these responses in context of broader plant and community responses to global change.  Group leaders: Sean Michaletz & Joseph Garen -->


<!-- ### Climate change impacts on traits and ecosystem functioning.  -->

<!-- This group will study how trait composition influences ecosystem functioning by measuring CO2-flux within and across plant communities. Group 4 will collaborate with group 2 to access data on community trait shifts, and mainly focus on ecosystem carbon dynamics in response to climate change, but also nitrogen deposition and grazing. Group leader: Joseph Gaudard -->


<!-- ### Remote assessment of plant traits and ecosystem functioning.  -->

<!-- This group will use technologies based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV/drone) in combination with measurements from the experiments to assess how remotely-sensed data (e.g., reflectance spectra) can capture plant and ecosystem functional shifts from leaf to landscape-scale. The group will collaborate with groups 1-4 over community-level data. Students applying for this group should have experience with geospatial analyses. Group leaders: Marc Macias-Fauria & Marcus Spiegel (TBC) -->


<!-- ### Culturally relevant science communication.  -->

<!-- This group will use questionnaires and interviews to engage with the local community, with the aim of learning their knowledge and perceptions of climate change (especially relevant to local considerations). Group 6 will conduct research locally in Western Norway, compare with results from previous PFTC courses in Peru and Svalbard, and draft a manuscript for publication. Group leader: Sehoya Cotner -->



<!-- ## General reading lists -->

<!-- All the papers are available in the [class folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YdsXQNhaIbKaHmFxGzv6yFByXglITcel) on google drive. -->

<!-- Aim of this document: To help you prepare for the PFTC6 in Norway!  -->
<!-- To prepare you for the Norwegian field component of the course, the course will consist of three ‘pre-course’ activities. These activities will take place before we meet in Norway and will take place in April and May.  -->

<!-- (i) Reading List - The course reading list has three parts.  The first set of readings are introductory readings to orient you in the field and study system. The second set of readings are ‘core trait papers’ that together will form the scientific background for the course. The third set of readings are specific papers for each group.  -->

<!-- (ii) External pre-course lectures - These lectures will provide a foundational set of material for several of the topics covered in the course. These are pre-record some overview presentations / lectures  for you to help you prepare for the course. We will expect you to cover this material in your own time. -->

<!-- (iii) Sub-group discussions - Finally, there will be discussions within your groups. The group leaders will contact you about the dates and specifics of these discussions. -->
<!-- For instructions on how to access / use the course papers and the other resources we will make available to you pre-course, please read on!  -->


<!-- ### Introduction to the alpine grassland in Norway -->

<!-- Alpine ecosystems cover a large area in Norway. The vegetation is divided into the low, mid and high alpine zones. The low alpine zone is dominated by ridge and snowbed vegetation. The mid alpine zone is dominated by grasslands, and heath vegetation and shrubs are missing. The high alpine zone is non-continuous, and sparsely vegetated by a few herbs and grasses and mostly dominated by mosses and lichens. -->

<!-- Grasslands in Norway are often semi-natural. Traditionally, alpine grasslands have been managed for grazing, and mowing, and have resulted in grass- and herb-dominated communities in the lowlands and also in sub-alpine areas where mountain summer-farming has been practiced. During the last century the traditional summer-farming management has gradually declined due to decreasing economic value. -->

<!-- Cold ecosystems can store large amounts of carbon on the soil, because processes such as respiration and decomposition are slow. Norwegian grasslands are therefore potential carbon sinks and changes due to warmer climate can alter the carbon cycling considerably. -->

<!-- The relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors for plant community composition along temperature and precipitation gradients in grasslands in western Norway. This paper describes the abiotic and biotic conditions of some of the study sites we will use in the PFTC6 course (Klanderud, Vandvik, & Goldberg, 2015). -->
<!-- Climate change impacts on biodiversity and biotic interactions in Western Norway (Vandvik et al., 2020). -->
<!-- Grazing and alpine plant diversity. Grazing in alpine ecosystems has a long tradition in Norway and grazing have a profound impact on the plants community and structure. This paper identify processes that influence diversity at different spatial scales with a particular focus on grazing (Austrheim & Eriksson, 2008). -->
<!-- Carbon fluxes and stocks in Norwegian alpine habitats. This paper quantifies the carbon stocks and fluxes in different alpine habitats in Norway (Sørensen et al., 2018). -->


<!-- ### Core plant functional trait-based science background papers -->
<!-- The wider trait-based literature is huge, (mostly) really quite exciting, and growing fast. The course goal is to give you a practical introduction into the literature and field-work related challenges of trait-based ecology - how to collect, curate, manage and report high-quality trait research data, and how to tailor trait-based field campaigns to a  variety of specific research purposes (i.e., the five groups).  We will thus assume that you have a basic understanding of plant ecology and some background in plant functional trait-based ecology. While there are many other, newer, and relevant papers to choose from in the wider trait-based literature, we therefore ask you to carefully (re)read a few core trait-based ecology papers to make sure we all have a common core background syllabus. We also provide one paper per group to make sure that we all have reflected a bit on the other groups’ work. Finally, we provide perspectives on more methodological issues; ranging from how to measure traits in the field in a standardized way, via decisions relating to experimental (and more generally, study) designs, to guidance on how to optimize your global change ecology experiment for synthesis and data reuse.  -->

<!-- All of these issues will be discussed in detail during the course. By reading up, participating in discussions and lectures, we ensure that we can hit the ground running and have good discussions and progress during what will feel like a relatively limited time (believe us!) in Norway. Specifically:   -->

## How to measure plant functional traits

Based on Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013.

These are instructions for how to measure leaf functional traits using the traits wheel^TW^ for PFTC courses.

```{r trait-wheel, out.width='100%'}

```


```{r collect, out.width='10%'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/Collect.png")

```

**A Sampling individual plants in the field (Intraspecific group)**

Follow the species list for our group, starting with the highest priority species for each site.
DO NOT collect plants from within the plots or the trampled zone around the plots.
Find 10 individuals of each species, ideally each individual should have five leaves, but three leaves is a minimum. Each individual should be at least two meters away from each other, to avoid sampling individuals from the same genetic individual. Choose reproductively mature adults with fully expanded leaves (i.e. not seedlings). Choose individuals with healthy-looking leaves (i.e. not grazed, no signs of pathogen or herbivore attack, no discoloration).
Before uprooting the individual, measure its height (see below). For very large individuals that are too large to uproot (e.g. ferns), collect 5 leaves from the individual, making sure to include the petiole.
If you are uncertain whether something is a leaf vs. leaflet, ask your group leader.
If you cannot find 10 individuals of each species, that is ok. After a reasonable search, move on.


**B Sampling individual plants in the field (Global change group):**

You are provided with a species list for each plot. We sample species outside each plot; focus on sampling around one plot at a time. Minimize trampling as much as possible so as to not affect height measurements.
The plots range from 1 (upslope) to 5 (downslope). They are marked with coloured flagging tape. 
DO NOT collect plants from within the plots or the trampled zone around the plots.
Sample leaves only from the area parallel to the plot (i.e. on the same part of hillslope) but within the flagging tape that marks the perimeter of the site (see Figure 1).
Find 5 individuals of each species in the sampling zone around the plot. Choose reproductively mature adults with fully expanded leaves (i.e. not seedlings). Choose individuals with healthy-looking leaves (i.e. not grazed, no signs of pathogen or herbivore attack, no discoloration).
Before uprooting the individual, measure its height (see below). For very large individuals that are too large to uproot (e.g. ferns), collect 5 leaves from the individual, making sure to include the petiole.
If you are uncertain whether something is a leaf vs. leaflet, ask your group leader.
If you cannot find 5 individuals of each species, that is ok. After a reasonable search, move on.

<!-- Add some figure showing how to measure height -->
```{r heigh, out.width='100%', fig.cap="... "}

#knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/...")

```


**Measuring height of individual plants in the field:**

Record the height of the individual plant before removing it from the ground. 
Measure the tallest point of the individual plant, excluding fruits and flowers. Do not stretch the plant if it bends.
Record this measurement legibly (see figure 1 for how to write numbers) on flagging tape
Tie the flagging tape around the individual securely and place individual in bag with wet paper towels for transfer to lab


```{r numbers, out.width='100%', fig.cap="The one and only approved way to write numbers! "}

knitr::include_graphics("images/trait_wheel/numbers.png")

```


**Preparing leaves for measuring traits in lab:**

Select one (for the fire group) or five (for the intraspecific group) healthy, mature, undamaged, sun leaf per individual
For analysing chemical traits such as percent P, C, N and isotopes, a certain amount of dry biomass is needed. Make sure that we are collecting 0.03 g  (30 mg) dried leaf material. Otherwise select several leaves until there is enough dry weight (bulk sample)
If a species does not have leaves, e.g. Baccharis (wings), we will collect a certain length of the stem. Please note on the envelope how much leaf material that was selected (in cm).
Include petiole and rachis (see figure 2)
Pat dry if there is visible water on the surface
Add a barcode and a sticker to the envelope. Attach the sticker with a stapler.
Fill in all information between ‘collection day’ and ‘Bulk nr/length’, see figure 3 below. Check table below for options for the information.
Place the leaf inside the envelope
Put the envelope in a box for the next step. Make sure the envelopes are kept wet at all times.

```{r label, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Sticker and barcode example"}

knitr::include_graphics(c("images/trait_wheel/label.png", "images/trait_wheel/barcode.gif"))

**Wet mass**

Make sure the envelopes are still kept wet.
Weigh each leaf and write the weight on envelope, including all digits.


**Scanning**

Connect your Laptop to PI
Connect PI with ethernet cable to your laptop
Connect scanner to the PI
Connect barcode scanner to the PI
Connect power cable to the PI

Wait for one minute.

**Scanning**

Make sure the envelopes are still kept wet.
Check that the scanner is clean and free of debris. Clean if needed.
Place wet leaf face-down on the scanner
Make sure the leaf is not folded and that leaflets do not overlap. The leaf should not go all the way to the edge of the scanner, because each picture will be cropped.
You can cut the leaf into several pieces if needed, but please make a remark if you do so (e.g. cut 3). You can tape the leaf to the scanner if it folds (e.g. grasses)
For graminoids (grasses, sedges, rushes):
Spread graminoid blades flat and tape to scanner if necessary to hold them in place
Exclude the leaf sheath (see picture)


Scan, save and check the leaf: 
Click on the leaf icon (only needs to be done the first time). This will start the scanning program. If the scanner cannot be found, wait for a bit and try again.
Check the settings of the scanner. These should be set as standard, so please don’t touch them if not needed. 
The scan should be saved in Desktop/leaf_scans/
Type: JPEG
Colour
Full colour range
300dpi. 
Press scan (at the bottom)
Adjust the zoom (about 25%)
Check scan (has the whole leaf been scanned, is the leaf not upside down, dirt on the scan, etc.). Repeat the scan if something is not ok.
Click on the green save button to save the scan. Make sure the cursor marks the filename (should be default). Scan the barcode on the envelope. The filename should be something like: AAA4667
When the scan is saved, the PI will check that the LeafID and that the scanning settings (dpi, etc.) are correct. If anything is wrong, it will open a window with an error message. Please read it!


```{r error, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Error message"}

#knitr::include_graphics()


```

Click anywhere in the window and it will disappear.
Save the scan with the correct name or scan the leaf again if the settings are wrong. MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE SCAN WITH THE WRONG NAME OR SETTING!!!
Tick the box on the envelope that the leaf has been scanned.

When you are finished with scanning click on the yoda icon. This will check the leafIDs. If anything is wrong it will open a window and indicate which scans are wrong.
Make sure to fix all the wrong leafIDs and not to have duplicate scans before leaving the station.
Copy all the scans onto a stick and deposit them on the PFTC5 hard drive.
Shut down the pi. Wait 1 min to disconnect it from the power.


**Leaf thickness**

Make sure the envelopes are still kept wet.
Thickness varies over the surface of the leaf; generally, the leaf is thickest at the midrib, primary veins, margins, and leaf base. Avoid the midrib when measuring leaf thickness, unless the leaf is too small. 
Take three thickness measurements at several points on the lamina. From this, we will later calculate the average thickness. If the leaf is small, it may not be possible to take three unique measurements.
Ferns: Make sure you do not measure thickness on the spore-producing sori on the lower side of fern frond.


**Data entry**

Ideally the envelope should still be kept wet until this point and then dried. In case any information is missing.
Copy a template of the PFTC5_Peru_2020_LeafTraits.xlsx file onto your computer.
Connect a barcode scanner to your computer
Open the excel file
Scan the barcode of an envelope. Make sure that your cursor is in the right cell (ID)
Enter all the data that is on the envelope (for details see table below)
If any of the information is missing, check if it has been forgotten. Has the leaf been scanned, one thickness measurement is missing, etc. If anything is missing bring the leaf back to the according station in the trait wheel.
When finished, check the box on the envelope that the data has been entered.
Take a picture of the envelope.

**Dry mass**
 
The leaves will be dried in the oven for 72 hours.

The leaves will be dried and weighed again in Cusco after the course.



### Data checking  

Check all the scanned leaves. Full scan on the image, nothing else scanned, dirty scan, number of leaves, has leaf been cut, is there a remark on this?
Check valid leafID
Check if the variables have valid entries. E.g. correct day, site name, elevations, etc.
Check if missing values can be found on the envelope or retrieved from the data
Check if traits have unrealistic values
